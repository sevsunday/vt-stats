# VT Stats — Data Dictionary

## 1. Overview

VT Stats is a static-site dashboard for BattleZone match statistics. The system has three stages:

1. **Raw Data** — Match events are captured by the [statsgate](https://github.com/VTrider/statsgate) collector as Protocol Buffer (protobuf) binary files.
2. **Processing Pipeline** — A Python script (`scripts/process_stats.py`) reads the raw protobuf data, aggregates statistics, and writes pre-computed JSON files.
3. **Browser Dashboard** — The static HTML/JS frontend loads the JSON and renders interactive charts, tables, and leaderboards.

```
data/sessions/<username>/*.binpb.gz   Raw session files (protobuf, gzip-compressed)
        │
        ▼
scripts/process_stats.py              Python pipeline
        │
        ├── data/odf.min.json         Weapon name database (ODF lookup)
        │
        ▼
data/processed/*.json                 Pre-computed JSON for the browser
        │
        ▼
index.html + JS                       Dashboard renders charts & tables
```

No data processing happens in the browser — all aggregation, attribution logic, and derived statistics are pre-computed by the pipeline.

## 2. Source Data — Protobuf Schema

The canonical schema is defined in `scripts/statsgate.proto`. Every match recording is a single `ClientStatSession` message containing a header and an ordered stream of events.

### ClientStatSession

The top-level container for one match recording.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `header` | `StatHeader` | Match metadata and player roster |
| `event_stream` | `repeated StatEvent` | Ordered list of all recorded events |

### StatHeader

Metadata captured at the start of the match.

| Field # | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `map` | `string` | Map filename (e.g. `havenvsr.bzn`) |
| 2 | `start_time` | `Timestamp` | Match start time (UTC) |
| 3 | `author_nickname` | `string` | Recording player's nickname |
| 4 | `author_steam64` | `uint64` | Recording player's Steam64 ID |
| 5 | `tick_rate` | `uint32` | Simulation tick rate (typically 20 ticks/second) |
| 6 | `s64_to_nick` | `map<uint64, string>` | Steam64 ID → Nickname lookup |
| 7 | `teamnum_to_s64` | `map<int32, uint64>` | Slot number (1-10) → Steam64 ID |
| 8 | `active_config_mod` | `string` | Server configuration mod identifier |
| 9 | `s64_to_teamnum` | `map<uint64, int32>` | Steam64 ID → Slot number (reverse of field 7) |
| 10 | `player_count` | `uint32` | Number of players in the match |
| 11 | `last_tick` | `uint32` | Final game tick (0 if not populated by collector) |

### StatEvent

A wrapper that holds exactly one event type via a `oneof`:

| Field # | Event Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `BulletInit` | A player fires a projectile |
| 2 | `BulletHit` | A projectile connects with a target |
| 3 | `DamageDealt` | Damage source side of a damage event |
| 4 | `DamageReceived` | Damage target side of a damage event |
| 5 | `UpdateTick` | Per-tick snapshot of all player states |
| 6 | `UnitDestroyed` | A unit was destroyed |
| 7 | `UnitSniped` | A snipe event occurred |

### BulletInit

Recorded when a recognized player fires a projectile.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick when the shot was fired |
| `shooter` | `uint64` | Steam64 ID of the player who fired |
| `ordnance_odf` | `string` | Weapon ODF identifier (e.g. `chaingun_c.odf`) |

Only player-fired projectiles are tracked. AI and structure shots are not recorded by the collector.

### BulletHit

Recorded when a projectile connects with any target.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick of the hit |
| `shooter` | `uint64` | Steam64 ID of the player who fired (0 if not a player) |
| `ordnance_odf` | `string` | Weapon ODF identifier |
| `victim` | `uint64` | Steam64 ID of the victim (0 if not a player) |
| `victim_odf` | `string` | ODF of the hit entity |
| `shooter_odf` | `string` | Shooter's vehicle ODF (not yet populated by collector) |

The pipeline uses `shooter` and `ordnance_odf` for hit counting per player per weapon.

### DamageDealt + DamageReceived (Adjacent Pair Rule)

These two events represent **two sides of the same damage instance** in the game engine. They **always occur as adjacent pairs** in the event stream — a `DamageDealt` is immediately followed by the corresponding `DamageReceived`.

**DamageDealt:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick |
| `shooter` | `uint64` | Steam64 ID of the damage source player. **0 if the source is not a player** (e.g. AI unit, structure). |
| `team` | `int32` | **Owning player's slot (1-10).** This is NOT a faction ID — it is the slot number of the player who owns the source entity. 0 = world prop. |
| `ordnance_odf` | `string` | Weapon ODF identifier. May be null for environmental damage. |
| `amount` | `float` | Damage amount (always matches the paired DamageReceived) |

**DamageReceived:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick |
| `victim` | `uint64` | Steam64 ID of the damage target player. **0 if the target is not a player** (e.g. AI unit, structure). |
| `team` | `int32` | **Owning player's slot (1-10).** Slot of the player who owns the target entity. 0 = world prop. |
| `ordnance_odf` | `string` | Weapon ODF identifier |
| `amount` | `float` | Damage amount |

#### The `team` Field

This is the most commonly misunderstood field. The `team` value is **always a player slot number (1-10)**, not a faction or team ID. A slot's faction is determined by convention: slots 1-5 = Team 1, slots 6-10 = Team 2. If a player owns AI units or structures, those entities share the player's slot number.

#### Attribution Logic

How the pipeline assigns credit based on the `shooter`/`victim` values:

| shooter | victim | Dealt Credit | Received Credit | Rivalry? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| > 0 (player) | > 0 (player) | Personal dealt to shooter | Personal received to victim | Yes |
| > 0 (player) | = 0 (non-player) | Personal dealt to shooter | Asset received to victim's owning slot | No |
| = 0 (non-player) | > 0 (player) | Asset dealt to shooter's owning slot | Personal received to victim | No |
| = 0 (non-player) | = 0 (non-player) | Asset dealt to owning slot | Asset received to owning slot | No |

**Skip conditions:**
- If `dd.team == 0` or `dd.amount == 0.0`, the **entire shooter side is skipped** (no dealt credit given). But the victim's received damage is still processed normally.
- If `dr.team == 0`, the victim side is skipped (world prop target).

### UpdateTick

Periodic state snapshots of all players. Currently captured by the collector but **not processed** by the pipeline (future: heatmaps, movement analysis).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick |
| `players` | `repeated PlayerState` | State of each player |

**PlayerState fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `player` | `uint64` | Steam64 ID |
| `position` | `Vec3` | World position (x, y, z) |
| `speed` | `float` | Current speed |
| `health` | `float` | Current health (actual HP, not ratio) |
| `ammo` | `float` | Current ammo (actual value, not ratio) |
| `odf` | `string` | Current vehicle ODF |

### UnitDestroyed

Recorded when a unit is destroyed. The pipeline tracks kills/deaths from this event.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick |
| `killer` | `uint64` | Steam64 of killer (0 if not a player) |
| `killer_team` | `uint32` | Killer's team slot |
| `killer_odf` | `string` | Killer's vehicle ODF |
| `victim` | `uint64` | Steam64 of victim (0 if not a player) |
| `victim_team` | `uint32` | Victim's team slot |
| `victim_odf` | `string` | Destroyed unit's ODF |

Note: `UnitDestroyed` events are not yet produced by the current collector version. The pipeline handler is ready for when they arrive.

### UnitSniped

Recorded when a snipe event occurs. The pipeline counts these per match.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `uint32` | Game tick |

Note: `UnitSniped` events are not yet produced by the current collector version.

### Player Identity

Players are identified by `uint64` Steam64 IDs. The header provides three lookup maps:

| Map | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `s64_to_nick` | `map<uint64, string>` | Steam64 → display name |
| `teamnum_to_s64` | `map<int32, uint64>` | Slot (1-10) → Steam64 |
| `s64_to_teamnum` | `map<uint64, int32>` | Steam64 → Slot (reverse) |

The pipeline builds `nick_map` (slot → name) by joining `teamnum_to_s64` with `s64_to_nick`.

### Faction Resolution

Teams (factions) are determined by player slot convention: slots 1-5 = Team 1, slots 6-10 = Team 2.

### Source-Level Filters

These are applied by the statsgate collector before data reaches the pipeline:

- **Collision damage** (`DAMAGE_TYPE_COLLISION`) is excluded at source — never appears in the data
- **Bullet events** are only recorded for recognized players (those in `s64_to_nick`)
- **Header snapshot timing:** The header is captured at the first tick — players who join/leave after that point are not reflected in team lists

---

## 3. Processing Pipeline

The Python pipeline (`scripts/process_stats.py`) transforms raw protobuf data into pre-computed JSON. Here is each step:

### Step 1: Session Discovery

The pipeline scans `data/sessions/` for username subdirectories. Within each, it finds all `.binpb.gz` files (gzip-compressed protobuf). Each file is paired with its submitter username (the parent folder name). Files are sorted by name within each user folder.

### Step 2: Protobuf Parsing

Each `.binpb.gz` file is decompressed with `gzip.open()` and parsed into a `ClientStatSession` protobuf message. This gives the pipeline access to the header and the complete event stream.

### Step 3: Weapon Name Resolution (ODF)

The `data/odf.min.json` database maps raw ODF strings to human-readable weapon names. The resolution chain tries these lookups in order (first match wins):

| Priority | Lookup | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `WeaponClass.ordName` → `wpnName` | `chaingun_c` → `Chain Gun` |
| 2 | `DispenserClass.objectClass` → `wpnName` | Dispenser class → parent weapon |
| 3 | `TargetingGunClass.leaderName` → `wpnName` | Targeting gun → parent weapon |
| 4 | Explosion mapping (Vehicle → torpedo/explosion → parent weapon) | Explosion ODF → source weapon |
| 5 | **Fallback:** Raw ODF string minus `.odf` extension | `unknown_wpn.odf` → `unknown_wpn` |
| 6 | **Null ordnance:** Display as `"Unknown"` | `null` → `Unknown` |

When multiple ODF strings resolve to the same display name, the raw ODF is appended in parentheses for disambiguation (e.g. `Shell Gun (shellgun_c)`).

### Step 4: Header / Roster Setup

The pipeline reads identity maps from the header:
- Builds `nick_map` (slot → nickname) by joining `teamnum_to_s64` with `s64_to_nick`
- Builds `slot_to_s64` directly from `header.teamnum_to_s64`
- Builds `s64_to_slot` directly from `header.s64_to_teamnum`
- Faction is determined by slot convention (1-5 = Team 1, 6-10 = Team 2)

### Step 5: Single-Pass Event Processing

The pipeline iterates through the event stream once, processing each event type:

| Event | What It Contributes |
|---|---|
| `BulletInit` | Shot count per player×weapon, faction shot totals, global weapon shot totals, tick range |
| `BulletHit` | Hit count per player×weapon, faction hit totals, global weapon hit totals, tick range |
| `DamageDealt` + `DamageReceived` | Personal dealt/received, asset dealt/received, faction totals, rivalry matrix, weapon damage, ODF collection |
| `UnitDestroyed` | Per-player kills/deaths, kill feed entries (killer/victim with vehicle ODFs) |
| `UnitSniped` | Snipe count for the match |

Damage events are consumed as adjacent pairs. The [attribution logic](#attribution-logic) from Section 2 determines where each damage value is credited.

### Step 6: Timeline Recomputation

After the main pass, the timeline is recomputed from scratch. This is necessary because `min_tick` is not known until all events are processed, so initial bucketing during the main pass may be inaccurate.

- Time is divided into **10-second buckets** based on tick rate
- Each bucket accumulates total damage dealt during that window
- Two parallel timelines are built: **by player** and **by faction**
- Asset damage (shooter = 0) is included in the faction timeline but not the player timeline

### Step 7: Derived Outputs

After event processing, the pipeline computes:

- **Match metadata:** ID (from start_time), map, date, duration, tick range, tick rate, player count, config mod, submitter, snipe count, team rosters
- **Leaderboard:** Sorted by personal damage dealt (descending). Each entry includes personal stats, kills/deaths, asset stats, and per-weapon breakdown.
- **Faction totals:** Aggregate dealt/received/shots/hits/accuracy per team
- **Rivalry matrix:** Player-on-player damage grid (shooter name → victim name → damage)
- **Top rivalries:** Top 5 bidirectional pairs sorted by total mutual damage
- **Weapon meta:** Per-weapon totals (damage, shots, hits, accuracy, user count)
- **Timeline:** Labels (M:SS format) with damage arrays per player and per faction
- **Asset damage:** AI/structure damage breakdown by player and by faction
- **Kills:** Kill leaderboard and kill feed (from UnitDestroyed events)

### Step 8: All-Matches Aggregation

When more than one match is processed, the pipeline builds cross-match aggregate stats:

- **Career stats:** Per-player totals across all matches (dealt, received, accuracy, kills, deaths, favorite weapon, best match, weapon breakdown)
- **Global weapon meta:** Weapon totals summed across all matches
- **Global rivalries:** Top 10 cross-match bidirectional player pairs
- **Meta:** Match count, total duration, maps played, date range, submitters list

### Replay Tab — Timeline Player

Animated playback of the same `timeline` data shown on the Combat tab, with transport controls and live companion stats.

| Displayed | JSON Path | Computed From |
|---|---|---|
| Animated chart (Players mode) | `timeline.by_player[name]` | Same per-bucket damage arrays, sliced to `[0..currentIndex]` each tick |
| Animated chart (Teams mode) | `timeline.by_faction["1" / "2"]` | Same per-bucket faction damage arrays, sliced to `[0..currentIndex]` each tick |
| Time labels / scrub range | `timeline.labels` | Bucket labels drive the current-time readout and scrub bar bounds |
| Playback interval | `timeline.bucket_seconds` | `intervalMs = (bucket_seconds × 1000) / speed` (1000ms at 10x with 10s buckets) |
| Kill markers on chart | `kills.feed[].tick` + `match.tick_rate` + `match.tick_range[0]` | `bucket = floor(((tick − tick_range[0]) / tick_rate) / bucket_seconds)`; markers only drawn up to `currentIndex` |

| Player colors | `buildPlayerColorMap(leaderboard_names)` | Same 15-color palette used across the dashboard for consistency |

Filter integration: the Replay tab consumes the client-filtered `data.timeline` object the same way the Combat tab does, so "Team" or "Player" filter selections narrow the animated chart and the running leaderboard to the selected subset. `by_faction` passes through unfiltered (matches the Combat tab's behavior).

## 6. Datapoint Glossary

Alphabetical reference of every statistic displayed in the dashboard.

| Datapoint | Definition | Source Events | Formula |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Accuracy (Player)** | Percentage of shots that connected | `BulletInit`, `BulletHit` | `shots_hit / shots_fired` |
| **Accuracy (Weapon)** | Per-weapon hit rate across all users | `BulletInit`, `BulletHit` | `total_hits / total_shots` per ODF |
| **Asset Damage Dealt** | Damage credited to a player's AI units or structures | `DamageDealt` where `shooter = 0` | Sum of `amount` grouped by owning slot (`team` field) |
| **Asset Damage Received** | Damage taken by a player's AI units or structures | `DamageReceived` where `victim = 0` | Sum of `amount` grouped by owning slot (`team` field) |
| **Best Match** | The match where a player dealt the most personal damage | `leaderboard[].personal.dealt` | Max dealt across matches (career view only) |
| **Bucket Spotlight (Replay)** | Biggest contributor in the current playback bucket | `timeline.by_player[name][currentIndex]` | `argmax` of per-player damage at `currentIndex` |
| **Config Mod** | Server configuration identifier | `StatHeader.active_config_mod` | Direct from header |
| **Date** | When the match started | `StatHeader.start_time` | Protobuf Timestamp → ISO datetime |
| **Deaths** | Times a player's unit was destroyed | `UnitDestroyed` where `victim` = player Steam64 | Count per player |
| **Duration** | How long the match lasted | All events with `tick` | `(max_tick - min_tick) / tick_rate` |
| **Faction Accuracy** | Team-wide hit rate | `BulletInit`, `BulletHit` grouped by faction | `faction_hits / faction_shots` |
| **Hit Distribution** | Per-player breakdown of which targets were hit most, with damage context | `BulletHit` (hits) + `DamageDealt` rivalry (damage) | `{ hits: count, damage: total }` per shooter → victim pair. Dmg/Hit = `damage / hits` |
| **Faction Total Dealt** | All damage dealt by a team (players + assets) | `DamageDealt` grouped by faction | Running accumulator across all `DamageDealt` events |
| **Faction Total Received** | All damage received by a team (players + assets) | `DamageReceived` grouped by faction | Running accumulator across all `DamageReceived` events |
| **Favorite Weapon** | Weapon a player dealt the most damage with | `DamageDealt` per player per ODF | Weapon name with `max(dealt)` |
| **Kill Rivalry** | How many times one player killed another | `UnitDestroyed` where both `killer > 0` and `victim > 0` | Count grouped by killer → victim pair |
| **Kills** | Times a player destroyed a unit | `UnitDestroyed` where `killer` = player Steam64 | Count per player |
| **Map** | The BattleZone map played | `StatHeader.map` | Direct from header |
| **Matches Played** | Number of matches a player appeared in | Match presence | Count of matches containing this `player_id` |
| **Momentum (Replay)** | Which faction is dominating the current phase of playback | `timeline.by_faction` rolling 3-bucket sums | Faction ahead by >10% drives the arrow direction; otherwise "Even" or "Quiet" |

| **Player Count** | Number of named players in a match | `StatHeader.player_count` | Direct from header (fallback: `len(nick_map)`) |
| **Playhead (Replay)** | Continuous playback position expressed in buckets | `timeline.labels`, `timeline.bucket_seconds` | `progressBuckets` is a float 0.0 (empty: "0:00") → `totalBuckets` (full match), driven by `requestAnimationFrame` so the chart line, scrub thumb, time readout, and faction tug-of-war move continuously. Numeric panels (running leaderboard, bucket spotlight, momentum chip) snap per whole bucket so values stay readable. `prefers-reduced-motion` users get a fallback that steps per whole bucket via `setInterval` |
| **Ratio** | Damage dealt relative to damage received | `DamageDealt`, `DamageReceived` | `dealt / received`. Infinite (∞) when received = 0 and dealt > 0. |
| **Replay Speed** | How fast the Replay tab plays relative to real match time | `timeline.bucket_seconds` | `intervalMs = (bucket_seconds × 1000) / speed`; options 0.5x (slow-mo), 1x, 2x (default), 5x, 10x, 20x |

| **Total Dealt (Career)** | Lifetime personal damage dealt across all matches | `leaderboard[].personal.dealt` | Sum across all matches |
| **Total Received (Career)** | Lifetime personal damage received across all matches | `leaderboard[].personal.received` | Sum across all matches |
